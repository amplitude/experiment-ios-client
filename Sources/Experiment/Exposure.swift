/**
 * Improved exposure event for tracking exposures to Amplitude Experiment.
 *
 * This object contains all the required information to send an `$exposure`
 * event through any SDK or CDP to experiment. The resulting exposure event
 * must follow the following definition:
 *
 * ```
 * {
 *   "event_type": "$exposure",
 *   "event_properties": {
 *     "flag_key": "<flagKey>",
 *     "variant": "<variant>",
 *     "experiment_key": "<expKey>"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Where `<flagKey>`, `<variant>` and `<expKey>` are the `flagKey`,
 * `variant`, and `experimentKey` members on this class.
 *
 * For example, if you're using Segment for analytics:
 *
 * ```
 * analytics.track(name: "$exposure", properties: [
 *   "flag_key": exposure.flagKey,
 *   "variant": exposure.variant,
 *   "experiment_key": exposure.experimentKey
 * ])
 * ```
